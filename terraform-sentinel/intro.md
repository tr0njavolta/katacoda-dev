[Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel/) is the Policy-as-Code product from HashiCorp that enforces automated enforcement of logic-based policy decisions across all HashiCorp products.

It allows customers to implement policy-as-code in the same way that Terraform implements infrastructure-as-code.

The Sentinel Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to apply and test Sentinel policies including those that use mocks generated from Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise plans.

This **Sentinel & Terraform Cloud** environment provides you a place to create and test policies for your infrastructure in **30 minutes**.

This scenario follows the **Team & Governance** track in the [Terraform Learn guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/sentinel/sentinel-policies).
