[Sentinel](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel/) is the Policy-as-Code product from HashiCorp that automatically enforces logic-based policy decisions across all HashiCorp Enterprise products.

It allows users to implement policy-as-code in a similar way to how Terraform implements infrastructure-as-code.

The Sentinel Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to apply and test Sentinel policies, including those that use mocks generated from Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise plans.

This **Sentinel & Terraform Cloud** environment provides you a place to create and test infrastructure policies against pre-populated mock data.
